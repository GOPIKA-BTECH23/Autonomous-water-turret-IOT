# Autonomous-water-turret-IOT
Autonomous Water Turret IoT is a smart system designed to detect and extinguish fires using artificial intelligence and IoT technology. It uses a camera and a YOLOv5 deep learning model to identify fire in real time, then automatically aims a water jet at the fire with servo motors and activates a water pump.
